## 📖 Background

As AI experiences continue to penetrate consumer-grade terminal devices, mobile Agent research is at a critical juncture transitioning from "feasibility verification" to "large-scale application." GUI-based solutions have emerged as the optimal approach for the current stage in addressing complex mobile ecosystems and achieving scalable Agent capabilities, thanks to their universal compatibility with all apps and zero-cost integration without requiring app vendor adaptation. However, due to the highly fragmented nature of mobile application ecosystems, getting GUI Agents to truly work across different brands and device models often faces numerous engineering challenges: multi-device ADB connections, dependency installation, permission configuration, inference service deployment, task recording and replay. This means Agent developers and MCP users need to handle substantial engineering infrastructure work, making it difficult to focus on strategic innovation.

To address this challenge, we are open-sourcing GELab-Zero to accelerate the innovation and application deployment of GUI Agents. It consists of two main components:

- Plug-and-play complete inference engineering infrastructure that handles all the heavy lifting
- A 4B GUI Agent model capable of running on local computer

It provides a one-click launch experience similar to open-source GUI Agent MCP, can be deployed entirely locally, and puts the entire inference pipeline under your complete control. Specific capabilities include:

- **Local Deployment**: Supports 4B-scale models running on consumer-grade hardware, balancing low latency with privacy.
- **One-click Launch**: Provides unified deployment pipeline that automatically handles environment dependencies and device management.
- **Task Distribution**: Can distribute tasks to multiple phones while recording interaction trajectories for observability and reproducibility.
- **Three Agent Modes**: Covers multiple working modes including ReAct loops, multi-agent collaboration, and scheduled tasks.

These capabilities enable GELab-Zero to flexibly handle complex task flows in real-world scenarios and provide a solid foundation for future extensions.

For Agent developers, this infrastructure enables rapid testing of new ideas and strategies, validating interaction approaches; for enterprise users, it allows direct reuse of this infrastructure to quickly integrate MCP capabilities into product business.

## 📊 AndroidDaily: A Self-Built Benchmark Close to Daily Life

Current mainstream benchmarks mostly focus on productivity applications (such as email), but users' daily high-frequency usage is dominated by lifestyle service applications (such as food delivery, ride-hailing, social media, payments, etc.), and these scenarios better reflect the practical value of current GUI Agents.

To this end, we propose AndroidDaily: a multi-dimensional dynamic benchmark for the real world. We focus on empirical analysis of six core dimensions of modern life (food, transportation, shopping, housing, information consumption, entertainment), prioritizing popular applications that dominate these categories. This makes the tasks in the benchmark characterized by real-world interaction results (such as transaction payments, service bookings) and tight online-offline inheritance.

To balance evaluation comprehensiveness and execution efficiency, AndroidDaily adopts two evaluation modes:

### Static Testing

Contains 3146 actions. Provides task descriptions and step-by-step screenshots, requiring the Agent to predict the action type and action value (such as click coordinates, input text) for each step, primarily evaluating numerical accuracy. This method requires no complex engineering infrastructure and enables rapid, cost-effective large-scale model iteration and testing.

The action type distribution in static testing is as follows (total 3146 actions):

- **CLICK**: 1354 times - Click operations
- **COMPLETE**: 410 times - Task completion
- **AWAKE**: 528 times - App activation
- **TYPE**: 371 times - Text input
- **INFO**: 305 times - Information query
- **WAIT**: 85 times - Wait operations
- **SLIDE**: 93 times - Slide operations

#### AndroidDaily Static Benchmark Results


| Model                   | Accuracy  |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| GPT-4o                  | 0.196     |
| Gemini-2.5-pro-thinking | 0.366     |
| UI-TARS-1.5             | 0.470     |
| GELab-Zero-4B-preview   | **0.734** |

### End-to-End Benchmark

Contains 235 tasks. Conducted in a fully functional test environment (such as real devices or emulators), the Agent needs to autonomously execute tasks from start to finish, with overall task success rate as the evaluation metric. This setup has the highest ecological validity and truly reflects the Agent's comprehensive capabilities in complex environments.

The scenario distribution in the end-to-end benchmark is as follows:

- **Transportation**: 78 tasks (33.19%) - Ride-hailing, navigation, public transit, etc.
- **Shopping**: 61 tasks (25.96%) - E-commerce shopping, payment, order management, etc.
- **Social Communication**: 43 tasks (18.3%) - Messaging, social interactions, etc.
- **Content Consumption**: 37 tasks (15.74%) - News reading, video watching, content bookmarking, etc.
- **Local Services**: 16 tasks (6.81%) - Food delivery, on-site services, etc.

![Scene Distribution](./images/Scenario.png)

Typical tasks include ride-hailing, shopping, message sending, content bookmarking, food delivery ordering, etc. GELab-Zero-4B-preview achieves 75.86% success rate on AndroidWorld testing, demonstrating excellent performance on complex mobile tasks.

<!-- EN -->

For personal users doing local inference, we strongly recommend using the Ollama method for local deployment. This method has the advantages of simple installation and convenient use.

- MAC and Windows users can directly download from the official website and install visually: https://ollama.com/.
- Linux users can refer to the official documentation for installation: https://ollama.com/download/linux. The one-click installation command for Linux users is as follows:

```bash
# Download the latest Ollama AppImage for Linux
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
````

#### Step 1.2: GELab-Zero-4B-preview Model Setup

<!-- EN -->

After completing the ollama installation, you need to download and deploy the gelab-zero-4b-preview model using the following commands:

```bash
# To install huggingface cli if you don't have it
pip install huggingface_hub

# Download and install gelab-zero-4b-preview model
huggingface-cli download --resume-download stepfun-ai/GELab-Zero-4B-preview --local-dir gelab-zero-4b-preview

# Import the model into ollama
cd gelab-zero-4b-preview
ollama create gelab-zero-4b-preview -f Modelfile
```

To test if the model is installed successfully, you can use the following command:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
